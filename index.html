    <h2>About Me</h2>


    <div>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Austin Shea, and I was born and raised in Phoenix Arizona. I am currently pursuing a career in web/app development and am honing my skills to be the most well rounded Full-Stack Engineer that I can be.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have worked in fields such as Solar, Customer Service and Support, and more recently with a Software Company. I am hungry for my next challenge in life, and am excited that I have this opportunity to improve my skill-set.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am very outgoing and am great with people, but also have a knack for all things technical. I believe this will make me an asset not just as a developer, but as a leader, and teammate.
        </p>
