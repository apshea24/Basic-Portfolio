                        Hello, my name is Austin Shea, and I was born and raised in Phoenix Arizona. I am currently
                        pursuing a
                        career in web/app development and am honing my skills to be the most well rounded Full-Stack
                        Engineer
                        that I can be.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have worked in fields such as Solar, Customer Service and Support, and more recently with a
                        Software
                        Company. I am hungry for my next challenge in life, and am excited that I have this opportunity
                        to
                        improve my skill-set.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am very outgoing and am great with people, but also have a knack for all things technical. I
                        believe
                        this will make me an asset not just as a developer, but as a leader, and teammate.
                    </p>
